            <p class = "trial">During <b><i>World War II</i></b> planes were extensively changed and adapted for warfare. The United States flew Douglasses and Dauntlesses which were the fighter jets of the era.
            These planes were more faster and efficient than their world war one predecessors. The Japanese invented the 'zero' plane as well. Finally, the americans created a huge plan capable of dropping nuclear payloads.</p>

            <p class = "warplane1">During the <b><i>Jet Age</i></b> planes started to be equipped with jets and propellers were slowly being phased out on my commerical planes. The first jet ever made was the Havilland Comet.
            This plane revolutionized the way travel worked. It cut flight times by nearly in half and it allowed planes to climb to higher altitudes than before. Soon two companies began to shape the avaiation industry as we
            know of it today: Boeing and Airbus. In 1969, Boeing released the Boeing-747. This plane is known as the Queen of the Skies and truly marked the start of the Jet Age. Soon new research and development started to focus more on
            fuel efficiency instead of building behemoths of the sky.</p>
