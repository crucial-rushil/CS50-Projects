            <p class = "trial">The <b><i>Modern Age</i></b> consisted of planes that were made to travel non-stop transconinental routes without stops refueling. They were also built with a large capacity to fit hundreds of passengers in a single flight. For example, the maximum capacity of a Boeing 747 is 467 passengers in a 3-3-3 configuration.

            <p class = "trial2">The <b><i>Wright Brothers</i></b> later then toured Europe and the United States with their new profound innovation. Many Europeans, especially the French, doubted them at first. However, all doubts were cast aside after
            an airshow in France which stunned the crowd. The Wright brothers managed to solve the mystery of flight and create an airplane many years after DaVinci had made his famous sketches. The airplane was sought after because of its mobility and speed
            when compared to the balloon. Soon by World War I, planes were being used as reconnaisance tools.</p>

            <p class = "warplane1">During the first <b><i>World War</i></b> there were two types of planes used. The first was for aerial reconnaisance and the second was for fighting. Both the allied and axises parties would use small scout planes to spy on their adversaries.
            These planes would like the one to the right. They also used planes for fighting. The First World War marked a new era of fighting. It unlocked the second dimension. Now not only troops on the ground had to worry about ground threats, but they also had to worry about gunfire
            falling out of the sky. Dogfights, or aerial engagements in which two planes would square off, are not as common in either World War 1 or World War 2 as the media portrays them today.</p>
