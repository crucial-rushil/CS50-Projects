          <p class="trial">The <b><i>Wright Brothers</i></b> were credited as the first people to achieve flight in an airplane. They tested their invention at Kitty Hawk Beach, North Carolina on December 17th, 1903. The Wright Brothers
            recieved little to no formal education apart from the 3-4 years of highschool. They learned to make a plane because they grew up fixing and making bikes. This allowed them to become aquainted with
            the parts needed to build the airplane.</p>
          <p class="trial">The <b><i>Wright Brothers</i></b> later then toured Europe and the United States with their new profound innovation. Many Europeans, especially the French, doubted them at first. However, all doubts were cast aside after
            an airshow in France which stunned the crowd. The Wright brothers managed to solve the mystery of flight and create an airplane many years after DaVinci had made his famous sketches. The airplane was sought after because of its mobility and speed
            when compared to the balloon. Soon by World War I, planes were being used as reconnaisance tools.</p>

    <h2>Planes in World War 1</h2>
    <div class="container-fluid">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p class="trial">During the first <b><i>World War</i></b> there were two types of planes used. The first was for aerial reconnaisance and the second was for fighting. Both the allied and axises parties would use small scout planes to spy on their adversaries.
        These planes would like the one to the right. They also used planes for fighting. The First World War marked a new era of fighting. It unlocked the second dimension. Now not only troops on the ground had to worry about ground threats, but they also had to worry about gunfire
        falling out of the sky. Dogfights, or aerial engagements in which two planes would square off, are not as common in either World War 1 or World War 2 as the media portrays them today.</p>
